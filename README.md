Title - Rich Life
Authors - Kyle Sabo, Michael Lasak, Christopher Bejar, Ilyas Khaja

We decided to used JavaFX for this project. For two of our group members it is a brand new framework to work with, the other two had prior experience with JavaFX. Our thought process for creating this game was bitlife, where the player simulates life starting from 18 and makes choices on how to use their money to reach space. In game we have to user choose from a variety of life choices that can benefit or detriment to you, in the case of our game it will impact how much money the player has.
